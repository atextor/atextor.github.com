My PhD thesis
[Verknüpfung von Domänenwissen für ein Ontologie-basiertes IT-Management](http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hebis:34-2018051455498) 
was recently published and you can read it (in German). In it, I use ontologies to enable automated IT-management across
functional domains in a company. As everyone likes statistics, here are some:

| Statistic                                                                     |    Value |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------:|
| Number of lines of code for the prototype (Java)                              |     7596 |
| Number of lines of code for additional runtime system for Case study (Java)   |     3583 |
| Number of lines of code for data transformation for Case study (Scala)        |     3703 |
| Number of lines of manually created ontologies for Case study (OWL)           |      391 |
| Number of lines of programmatically generated ontologies for Case study (OWL) |   178725 |
| Number of lines of manually written rules (Jena Rules)                        |      778 |
| Number of lines of programmatically generated rules (Jena Rules)              |     2726 |
| Number of lines of the [COBIT Ontology](https://github.com/atextor/cobit5-ontology) developed as part of the thesis |   204411 |
| Number of citations in thesis                                                 |      273 |
| Number of lines of code for the text of the thesis (LaTeX)                    |     8186 |
| Number of lines of code for the diagrams of the thesis (TikZ/LaTeX)           |     5166 |
| Number of lines of code for the cication data of the thesis (RDF/Turtle)      |    15484 |
| Time to build the thesis with xelatex on my T420                              | 2:02.247 |
| Number of git commits for prototype and text (excluding Case study)           |      849 |
| Cups of coffee consumed (approx.)                                             |     3200 |
|                                                                               |          |
